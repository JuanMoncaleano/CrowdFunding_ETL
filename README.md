# CrowdFunding_ETL

Welcome to our Crowdfunding ETL Project! This project leverages the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to handle data from crowdfunding campaigns. We use Python, Pandas, and SQL for our data pipeline.

**Overview**

  In this project, we work with data from a crowdfunding platform. The data includes details of the campaigns and their associated contacts. We apply the ETL process to clean, reshape, and store this data, enabling further analysis and insights extraction.

**Project Steps**

  Data Extraction: We import data from two Excel files, crowdfunding.xlsx and contacts.xlsx, into separate Pandas dataframes.

  Data Transformation: We then transform these dataframes by cleaning data, handling missing values, renaming columns, converting data types, splitting columns, and creating new dataframes.

  Data Loading: Finally, we load the transformed data into CSV files. We also load these CSV files into a PostgreSQL database.
